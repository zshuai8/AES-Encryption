The invokation of my program is presented as follow:
run the java program, then the program should be waiting for 4 lines of inputs.
The first line is the plaintext or ciphertext. 
The second line is the key.
The third line is the mode, 1 as ECB mode, 0 as CBC mode.
The forth line is to identify if the user wants to encrypt a message or not, type "encrypt", the program should return encrypted message right after, otherwise the program should just interpret the action as decrpytion.

Example:
0ae2fdbf29ec124fb44a94f4623485aa

213fdf54805328a32381876f1c392ac6a1dc99344591f871

1

encrypt

These inputs represent user wants to encrpyt the messge with ECB mode.
